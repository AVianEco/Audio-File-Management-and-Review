# Audio-File-Management-and-Review

## OVERVIEW ##
Create a tracking database for audio files gleaned from wildlife recording devices, and review file sets for deficiencies. These scripts can be useful for analyzing recording drop outs, checking for sampling deficiencies, and creating a database of files to track your progress during analysis.  These scripts are referenced in our online and in-person introductory courses for bioacoustics. 

### AVAILABLE SCRIPTS ###
- Step 1: Creating a CSV for Audio File Tracking
- Step 2: Find Difficiencies in Scheduled Recordings

*Upcoming scripts will allow user to scrutinize this file list for recording deficiencies. Work in progress.
