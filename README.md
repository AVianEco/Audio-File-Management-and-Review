# Audio-File-Management-and-Review

## OVERVIEW ##
Create a tracking database for audio files gleaned from wildlife recording devices, and review file sets for deficiencies. These scripts can be useful for analyzing recording drop outs, checking for sampling deficiencies, and creating a database of files to track your progress during analysis.  These scripts are referenced in our online and in-person introductory courses for bioacoustics. 

## USAGE ##
